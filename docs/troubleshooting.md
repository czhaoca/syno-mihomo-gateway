## Exit codes (auto_update.sh)

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | success / no-op | nothing |
| `2` | partial failure | read the notification + `logs/auto-update.log` |
| `3` | config / preflight error | fix the reported precondition; nothing was changed |
| `4` | another run holds the lock | wait, or remove a stale `LOCK_DIR` if no run is active |
| `5` | ACR login failed | check `ACR_PASSWORD` / token expiry / registry host |

## macvlan self-reach

**Symptom:** from the NAS, `curl http://MIHOMO_IP:9090` or the dashboard "Add backend" times
out, but other devices work.

**Cause:** by Linux macvlan design a host **cannot** reach its own macvlan container's IP. This
is expected, not a bug.

**Fix / workaround:**
- Open the dashboard and run connectivity tests from a **different LAN device**.
- The updater's mihomo health probe already runs *inside* the container (`docker exec`) to avoid
  this; from the NAS you can do the same: `docker exec mihomo wget -qO- http://127.0.0.1:9090/version`.
- If you genuinely need host→container reach, add a macvlan shim interface on the NAS (advanced).

## Architecture mismatch (ARM NAS)

**Symptom:** updater logs `arch mismatch for … image=amd64 expected=arm64 - refusing to deploy`,
or a container crash-loops with `exec format error`.

**Cause:** `docker-china-sync` mirrors `linux/amd64` by default; your NAS is ARM.

**Fix:** add arm64 to the mirror (`--platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64` in
`docker-china-sync/images.txt`) and set `EXPECTED_ARCH=arm64`; or run on an Intel NAS. The guard
refusing to deploy is *protecting* you from a crash-loop — it's working as intended.

## Network missing after reboot

**Symptom:** after a NAS reboot, `docker compose up -d` or the updater fails with
`network tproxy_network … could not be found`, or the updater preflight aborts (code `3`).

**Cause:** a CLI-created macvlan does not always survive a reboot / Container Manager restart;
the parent interface can also change (`eth0` ↔ `ovs_eth0`).

**Fix:** add the **Boot-up** Task Scheduler entry that runs `scripts/setup_network.sh` (see
[Operations › Scheduling](operations.md#scheduling-on-dsm)). To recover now:
`sudo ./scripts/setup_network.sh && docker compose up -d`.

## Dashboard can't connect to the backend

Checklist:
- Using the **NAS IP** (`http://NAS_IP:WEB_UI_PORT`) for the UI, and the **mihomo IP** + 
  `CONTROLLER_PORT` for the *backend*?
- Testing from a non-NAS device (macvlan self-reach)?
- `CONTROLLER_SECRET` entered if you set one?
- Is the controller actually enabled? `docker exec mihomo wget -qO- http://127.0.0.1:9090/version`
  should return JSON. If not, check `docker logs mihomo` for a render/start error.

## Containers are healthy but LAN clients have no internet

Run the read-only structural diagnostic first:

```bash
sudo sh scripts/doctor.sh --egress
```

It checks the host TUN device, macvlan, Compose model, image architecture, controller, and the
in-container `mihomo-tun` dataplane. Exit `0` is structurally healthy, `2` is degraded external
proxy egress, and `3` is a local configuration/runtime failure. If it passes, test gateway and
DNS from a different LAN device because the NAS cannot reach its own macvlan child.

## mihomo won't start / crash-loops

```bash
docker logs mihomo --tail 80
```
Common causes:
- **Empty/garbled subscription or DNS** — the renderer fails loudly:
  `ERROR: subscription.txt has no usable URL` or `ERROR: DNS_… must be set`. Fix
  `config/subscription.txt` / the `DNS_*` keys in `.env`, then `docker compose up -d mihomo`.
- **`/dev/net/tun` missing** — run `sudo ./scripts/setup_network.sh`.
- **Wrong arch image** — see above.

## Subscription URL looks wrong in config.yaml

The renderer strips only an optional leading `Name=` label and preserves everything else,
including `?token=…&flag=…`. If your provider URL itself contains a literal `|` or `\`, those are
escaped for `sed`; a stray newline in `subscription.txt` is ignored (first valid line only).
Verify the rendered value:

```bash
docker exec mihomo grep -m1 'url:' /root/.config/mihomo/config.yaml
```

## ACR login fails (code 5)

- Confirm `DOCKER_REGISTRY` host, `DOCKER_USERNAME`, and `ACR_PASSWORD` (the latter is a secret;
  ensure `.env` is `chmod 600`).
- ACR access tokens can expire — regenerate in the Alibaba console.
- Test by hand: `printf '%s' "$ACR_PASSWORD" | docker login "$DOCKER_REGISTRY" -u "$DOCKER_USERNAME" --password-stdin`.

## Pulls are slow / time out

Network flakiness to ACR. The updater retries pulls (`PULL_RETRIES`/`PULL_RETRY_DELAY`) and
pulls **before** swapping, so a failed pull aborts without touching the running container.
Increase the retry env vars if needed, or schedule further from the mirror window.

## cloudflared tunnel down after an update

The blue-green path proves the new connector is connected before retiring the old one, and
keeps the candidate if the final rename fails. If you see only `cloudflared-candidate` running:

```bash
docker ps -a | grep cloudflared
docker rename cloudflared-candidate cloudflared      # promote it
```

For best results start cloudflared with `--metrics 127.0.0.1:<port>` (preserved across updates)
so the connected-check is precise instead of log-scraping.

## "no image changes" but I expected an update

The updater compares the **running** container's image to the freshly-pulled tag, and only
deploys refs that match `MIHOMO_IMAGE`/`METACUBEXD_IMAGE`/`CF_IMAGE`. If you set `UPDATE_IMAGES`
to a ref that differs from those three, it's pulled **cache-only** and you'll see a `WARN`. Align
them (see [Auto-Update › image refs](auto-update.md#image-refs)). Also confirm the mirror actually
pushed a new digest (check the `docker-china-sync` GitHub Actions run).

## CI didn't run

The pipeline triggers on branches `main` **and** `master`. If you use another branch name, add
it to `.woodpecker.yml`'s `when.branch`.

## Whole house lost internet

If devices use `MIHOMO_IP` as gateway/DNS and mihomo is down, they're cut off. Quickest
recovery: point the affected device's gateway/DNS back to the router, then fix mihomo
(`docker compose up -d mihomo`, check logs). Consider the kill-switch + maintenance windows for
risky changes.
